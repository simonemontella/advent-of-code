# advent-of-code 🎄💻

Not just challenges or funny puzzles, but my annual chance to improve my own programming skills.

I discovered advent-of-code in its very first year, when i was just a 14-year-old newbie programmer, and i loved it at once.

Now i'm officially into the adult world, during these years i studied and finally became a young computer engineer, but i still enjoy solving these puzzles, whenever i rembember of them.
I love using this as an opportunity to get-in-touch with new programming languages, algorithms and mathematical challenges.
