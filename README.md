# advent-of-code 🎄💻

Not just challenges or funny puzzles, but my annual chance to improve my own programming skills.
I noticed advent-of-code in its first year of living, when i was just a 14-year-old newbie programmer, and i loved it at once.
Now i'm officially into the adults world and i still enjoy solving their puzzles - whenever i rembember of them - but using it as the opportunity to get-in-touch with new technologies, programming languages and algorithms.
